                  The Talent Scheduling Problem
                  ------------------------------
    
This is a variant of cspLib entry prob039 Rehearsal Problem http://csplib.org/

For a description of the problem see the cspLib entry prob039 and the material in the
papers directory, in particular paper opt1993.pdf, smith2005.pdf and informs2011.pdf

What you have to do
-------------------
The exercise is in three parts. 

Part 1: edit the code in the code directory to give a valid model with a variable
ordering heuristic. Your model works as a "decision problem" anwering the question "Is 
there a timetable with hold day cost less than or equal to X?" where X is read in on
the command line along with the filename of a problem in the data directory.

Part 2: perform an empirical study on the problems in the data directory. You might
investigate performance of various variable ordering heuristics, how runtime varies as 
you tighten the film schedule cost, and how this varies across instances

Part 3: write a short (3 pages should be about right) report on what you have done,
any heuristics that you have used, heuristics that might be promising but were not
investigated and of course your empirical results.

What to submit
--------------
Via email, send pat@dcs.gla.ac.uk with subject Exercise 2 two files, TalentScheduling.java
and your report.pdf Include in your email your name and matric number 

Marking
-------
This is 15% of the course. As a guide expect about 10 marks for the edits made to 
the java source code and 5 marks for the report.

NOTE

As things progress hints and tips might emerge.
